 
# Software (installing on local machine)

1. **Install VStudio Code** (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    a)**Extensions** 
        i.	 **Live Server** ( Launch a development local Server with live reload feature for static & dynamic pages) 
        ii.  **Node Essentials**  (Essential extensions for node development and collaboration) 

2. **Download NodeJS** (https://nodejs.org/en/)
    Check the version of node: node -v

    Terminal compatible with Windows: http://mintty.github.io/

3. Installation of **Firebase tools** using CMD (it's necessary install in folder where are html files)
   **Important**: To setup communication between two html pages, user should have index.html and on-off page in two separate folders.
   In each folder do commands:
        a) npm install -g firebase-tools
        b) firebase login
        c) firebase init  


# Prerequisite

1. Registration on **TinkerCad** (https://www.tinkercad.com/)
2. Registration on **Firebase** (https://firebase.google.com/)
3. Registration on **Arduino** - optional (https://www.arduino.cc/)



# What is TinkerCad?

Tinkercad is a free, online 3D design and modeling tool that is widely used in the fields of computer science, engineering, and design. It is particularly popular for use in education and for prototyping electronic circuits and mechanical designs.

Tinkercad allows users to create and edit 3D models using a simple, web-based interface. It features a range of tools and features that make it easy to create and customize 3D models, including basic shapes, text, and basic 3D shapes; a library of pre-designed objects; and the ability to import and export files in various formats.

In addition to its 3D modeling capabilities, Tinkercad also includes a Circuit Design tool that allows users to design and simulate electronic circuits. This feature makes it a useful tool for prototyping and testing the behavior of circuits before building them in real life.

# What is Firebase? 

FIrebase is a mobile and web application development platform developed by Google. It provides a range of services and tools that developers can use to build and manage applications, including:

a) Real-time database 
b) Authentication: Tools for verifying user identity and managing user accounts
c) Hosting: A hosting platform for static and dynamic web content, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files.

d) Cloud Functions: A serverless environment for executing code in response to events triggered by Firebase features or HTTP requests.

e) Cloud Storage: A scalable and secure object storage solution for storing and serving user-generated content.

f) Cloud Messaging: A messaging platform for sending push notifications and in-app messages to users.

# What is Arduino? 

Arduino is an open-source hardware and software platform for building electronic devices and interactive objects. It is widely used in the fields of Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, and physical computing, and is popular for its simplicity, versatility, and low cost.

At its core, Arduino consists of a microcontroller (a small computer that can be programmed to perform a wide range of tasks) and a software development environment that allows users to write and upload code to the microcontroller. The microcontroller can be connected to a variety of sensors and actuators (such as motors, LEDs, and buttons) to create interactive projects and control physical devices.

Arduino is designed to be easy to use, even for people with no prior experience in programming or electronics. It features a user-friendly software development environment and a large community of users who share resources and support each other through online forums and social media.

Overall, Arduino is a powerful and flexible platform that is well-suited for a wide range of applications in IoT, robotics, and physical computing.
