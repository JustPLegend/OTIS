  /*The "randomSeed" function is a built-in function in 
  the Arduino programming language (based on the C++ 
  programming language) that is used to initialize the 
  random number generator. 
  
  It is typically used in conjunction with the
  "random" function, which generates a 
  random number within a specified range.

  The "randomSeed" function takes a single argument, which 
  is used to "seed" the random number generator.
  A seed is a value that is used to initialize the
  generator and determine the sequence of random numbers that it 
  will produce. By using different seeds,
  you can generate different sequences of random numbers. */

  //for 1 second between each random number generation
